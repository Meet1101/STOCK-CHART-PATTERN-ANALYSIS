# STOCK-CHART-PATTERN-ANALYSIS

• Utilized time-series dataset to generate stock price pattern graphs, storing them in directories named
  by their respective classes.

• Applied pre-processing techniques to enhance image data for CNN model training , achieving
  accurate class predictions.

• Employed LSTM for direct time-series data analysis without converting it into graphical form, with CNN
  achieving superior accuracy despite LSTM’s application.
